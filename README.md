# Weather PWA Next

Weather PWA is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Next.js, designed to provide real-time weather updates for any location worldwide. The app fetches weather data from OpenWeather API, allows users to search locations using OpenWeather Geolocation API, and integrates Google Maps API for seamless location discovery.

This PWA supports push notifications, has location and voice search features and can be installed on mobile and desktop devices for a native-like experience.
